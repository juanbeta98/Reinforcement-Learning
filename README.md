# Reinforcement-Learning
This repository is a collection of resources that I've gathered during my journey with Reinforcement Learning.

- [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/juanbeta98/Reinforcement-Learning/tree/main/Jupyter%20Notebooks): A variety of Jupyter Notebooks with both theoretical content and practical implementations.
- [Lab](https://github.com/juanbeta98/Reinforcement-Learning/tree/main/Lab): Files related to ongoing projects and experiments that I'm currently working on.
