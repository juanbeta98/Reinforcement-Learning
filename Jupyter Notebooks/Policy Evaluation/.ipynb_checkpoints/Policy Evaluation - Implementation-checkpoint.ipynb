For the first 500 meters of immersion (1000m, 900m, 800m, 700m, 600m), only calculated maneuvers can be performed as these are safer for the ship and its tripulation.

Finally, if there are over 1000 samples, a calculated maneuver will be performed with a probability of 0,9 and an improvised with 0,1.
